# 1st_attempt

This is my first attempt containing :

   -operator overloading 
   
   -templates.
 
It is a primitive version of implementation. You can see it or skip it.

# 2nd_attempt

This is my second attempt containing :

   -operator overloading
   
   -templates 
   
   -expression templates.
   

However it cannot calculate the combinations of operators.You can see it or skip it.


# final_competency_test

This is my final and successful attempt. I used the following concepts:
   
   -expression templates
   
   -lazy evaluation 
   
   -operator overloading
   
   -templates 
   
   
It works under all conditions.
